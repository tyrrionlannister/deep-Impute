# **My Imputation App**

A deep learning-powered application for imputing and denoising single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, designed to enhance the quality of downstream biological analysis. The application uses a neural network-based approach to address dropout issues in scRNA-seq datasets, providing accurate and efficient imputation.
