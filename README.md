My Imputation App
A deep learning-powered application for imputing and denoising single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, designed to enhance the quality of downstream biological analysis. The application uses a neural network-based approach to address dropout issues in scRNA-seq datasets, providing accurate and efficient imputation.

Features
Preprocessing: Handles log normalization, variance filtering, and dimensionality reduction (PCA).
Deep Learning Model: Implements an autoencoder-based architecture for data imputation.
Evaluation Metrics: Calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² scores to assess imputation quality.
Web Interface: Allows users to upload datasets, perform imputation, and download results.
Technologies Used
Backend: Python, Flask.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn.
Data Handling: pandas, NumPy.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher.
Required libraries: TensorFlow, pandas, scikit-learn, Flask.
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-imputation-app.git
cd my-imputation-app
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open the app in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Usage
Upload Data:

Navigate to the app's upload page and select a .csv file containing scRNA-seq data.
The dataset should have rows as cells and columns as genes.
Perform Imputation:

Click on "Impute" to process the data. The app uses preprocessing and a trained autoencoder model to fill in missing values.
Download Results:

Once the imputation is complete, download the imputed data and view performance metrics like MSE and R².
